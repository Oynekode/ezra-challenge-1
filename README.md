# Code Refactor Starter Code

First step taken to refactor starter code was to fix any links that weren't working.
    > Search Engine Optimization link fixed by changing:
    <div class="search-engine-optimization">

    to

    <div id="search-engine-optimization" class="search-engine-optimization">

Overall, the structure of the code was 'tidied' and is easier to read
